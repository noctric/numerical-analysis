Numerical analysis
====

This repository contains scripts mainly written in python to process/calculate basic and primitive numerical analysis problems.
These include LU decomposition, Gauss equation solver and some other well known methods.

## Dependencies
 
The project was mainly done using Python 2 and often includes the numpy library.

## Disclaimer

The repository contains tasks done by SCP Students and were completed in a learning process. The main goal is not efficiency, but fully understanding the structure and exact process of solving given problems. _Also there is no absolute guarantee of correctness._
**This is a joint effort and credit should go out to tutors, professors and fellow students**
